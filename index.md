## Screenshots of Source Control

### These are the pictures of the commands from Git:
![git](screenshots/GitCloneRepo.png)
![git2](screenshots/GitBranchCheckout.png)
![git4](screenshots/GitAddCommitPush.png) 
[The README file I first made:](README.md)


This was an **interesting** part of the source control. 
The main part of my code is a bunch of:
```
git add
git commit
git push origin add-read-me
```

### These are the pictures of the VSCode UI:

This took *longer* than expected. ~~I should have switched to Business~~


We can also do math: x<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> = 4. As a wise man once said: 
> MATH is M.ath A.llows T.hinking to H.appen

The website I looked at to get all these shapes is [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

## Lists 
This is what an unordered list looks like:
- Hi
- Hello
- Welcome

This is what an ordered list looks like:
1. Nice
2. Cool
3. Amazing

A cool list to make is a task list:
- [x] Finish my HW
- [ ] Watch some pre lectures
